# organoid-profiler
A tool for the automated high-throughput and quantitative characterization of morphological features and fluorescence signals of organoid and spheroid cultures. At the moment it uses ImageJ functions and is written in Jython, we plan to write it fully in python in the future.

A web interface for this project is available at https://orgprofiler.com/
